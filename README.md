## Hello! 👋

My name is Jasmine, and I'm a developer and artist based in Denver!

I specialize in practical and fun applications with a girly twist 🎀

I'm currently learning Electron to create a women's health app that runs directly on your device!

My hobbies are coding, drawing/painting, reading, and sculpting
